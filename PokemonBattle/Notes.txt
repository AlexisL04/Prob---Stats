A pokemon Deck:

    A deck is exactly 60 cards
        It will be any combination of the following:

        Pokemon cards - Charmander
        Trainer Cards - Example Research
        For both pokemon and trainer, you can play unlimited

        Energy Cards - Example Fire
        you can only play 1 energy per turn

    Restriction: Must have at least 1 pokemon. 
    

Game Structure 
    
    You flip a coin to determine who goes first

    Both players draw 7 cards.  
        If any player does not have a pokemon in their hand, they must reveal their hand, return the cards into the deck,
        and reshuffle their deck, and redraw 7 cards   
        
        The opponent may then draw 1 extra card 

    The above may repeat until both players have a pokemon in their hand

    Both players put down a pokemon (up to 6 of them)

    Both players put 6 cards from the top of their deck to the side and call it the "prize" pile
        These piles are independantly stacked, your own prize pile and your oponents prize pile


A turn in pokemon 
    Draw 1 card.

    // Use a method to grab user input "1-5"
    // Switch cases can be used for this
    The repeat the following as needed:
        play exactly 1 energy per turn      Case 1
        Play trainer card.                  Case 2
        Play a pokemon card                 Case 3
    
    Attack ends your turn                   Case 4

    or just end your turn by "passing"      Case 5

How to win a Game

    // At the start of each turn, use a series of if statements to check if any of these conditions are met

    You win the game, if you can take all 6 of your own prizes from the prize pile.
        You get a single prize for every enemy pokemon you knock out ( from your own prize pile)

        You will get to put the card into your hand.

    Second win condition: your opponent has 0 pokemon in play. 

    Last win condition: Your opponent can not draw a card because their deck is empty *At the start of their turn

Caveats
    You can retreat once per turn, you pay for it by discarding an energy card equal to the cost of the retreat

    This is different than attacking, where you do not discard a card, unless the pokemon says so.

    A pokemon gets energys attached to them
